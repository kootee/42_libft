# Standard C Library functions
This repo contains implementations of a handful of C Standard Library (libc) functions. These functions were written as part of a 42 School project, which worked as an introduction some core concepts of C programming, such as dynamic memory allocation and memory management, string manipulation, pointers and linked lists.

## Library functions included
memset
bzero
calloc
memcpy
memmove
memchr
memcmp
strlen
strdup
strlcat
strlcpy
strchr
strrchr
strnstr
strncmp
atoi
isalpha
isdigit
isalnum
isascii
isprint
toupper
tolower
substr
strjoin
strtrim
split
itoa
strmapi
striteri
putchar_fd
putstr_fd
putendl_fd
putnbr_fd

## Linked list functions (not standard library)
lstnew_bonus
lstadd_front_bonus
lstsize_bonus
lstlast_bonus
lstadd_back_bonus
lstdelone_bonus
lstclear_bonus
lstiter_bonus
lstmap_bonus

## Usage
After downloading the repository use *Make* or *Make all* --> this creates the static library "libft.a". The library can then be included in a program.
Make main: compiles the main.c which contains tests for all the functions.
